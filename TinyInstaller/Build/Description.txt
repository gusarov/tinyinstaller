This is an assembly that is required to build your custom installer
It contains an MSBuild tasks and targets to override you building process.
This assembly is supposed to be distributed and configured using NuGet only for building you installer and not for distrbuting with it.

During compilation the target project should depend on primary output projects for installation. They will fetch their required references during a build process. All output files of target project will be injected into resultant installer as embeded resources. Then installer itself can extract this files during installation.
